	 * Rationale is quite obvious: firstly, "today" value in Date & Time-related frameworks
	 * is very frequently special-cased or at least exhibits slighlty different
	 * UI/UX; secondly, any CPU-bound calculations are better off somewhere else than
	 * inside drawing/layout code.
	 * Anyway, Time Profiler is also suporting my theoretizations giving by yealding
	 * incredible and suspicious 2049x improvements …in some other code from some
	 * other people. But seriously speaking, I did not bother to measure minor (but
	 * definnitely measurable) ~2-5% improvements gained just here and was more focused
	 * on overall library code performance.
